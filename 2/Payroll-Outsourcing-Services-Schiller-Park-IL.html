<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. 4. POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it. Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features. Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
<p>Reward your best customers with a loyalty program tracked in your POS system. If you want control over your profit and loss, you need to start with a good inventory management function. Restaurant owners and managers can always check on their business anytime, even while on the go, thanks to TouchBistro's dependable connection and cloud-based menu management and reporting functionality. Businesses can access the software via the internet, or though iPad or iPhone apps.</p>
<p>The highly functional software ensures better table and menu management, inventory management, and portable operations with portable app reporting. It can make a real difference to how much time you spend on processing sales, replenishing stock and even training your staff. The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time. With POS software, restaurant managers and owners can meet many of their practical business needs, from managing daily service all the way up to high-level analytics.</p>

They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>

<p>You want to be sure that your POS system can handle all of these latest emerging systems, but you also need to know if that implementation will hinder or help your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (aka PCI DSS)-compliance efforts or whether it will please or annoy your customers.
