<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. You'll probably want a traditional set-up with a full-service POS if you have a retail store , salon, dry cleaner, or quick-serve restaurant Consider countertop POS systems, which are available in various sizes and take less space than traditional cash registers. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Upserve is an all-in-one restaurant management solution that combines payment processing, point of sale, inventory management, and reservation systems.

Modern POS systems are commonly programmable or allow enhancement with third-party software programs.</p>
<p>Vend is a web based point of sale and stock management system that integrates seamlessly with Shopify.
