Hike is a leading retail POS software in the cloud with everything you need to run & grow your business. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails. Keep in mind that, if you are going to be accepting credit and debit cards (and most businesses must), you're going to need a service that can process those payments.
