<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>It used to be that as a small-business owner, you had just a few ways to accept payments from your customers. Recently purchased by Upserve, the low-cost, user-friendly Upserve caters to bars, clubs, and restaurants. The POS hardware includes an internet-enabled device that can run the POS software, plus transaction tools like a receipt printer and a cash drawer. Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Customers can pay by chip, swipe and tap like Apple Pay® and Google Pay, at the point of sale or on the go. Both the retail and restaurant versions of its POS software have a rich assortment of back-office tools to help you manage your business, with inventory, purchase ordering, reporting and CRM features. One such function includes the synergies, which are created by assimilating them with different kinds of back-end applications like inventory management and customer relationship management ( CRM ).</p>

<p>Lightspeed Retail POS has a bit of clunky user interface, but it has all the features that most smaller retailers will be looking for in a point of sale solution.

It's also easy to open and close tabs for customers by simply swiping their credit card through the system.</p>

This software supports Offline modes as well as Online modes and it gives immense security to your data in both the modes.

Modern POS systems for bars remedy this problem for bar owners by leveraging cloud technology to create always-accessible reports. The point of sale offers a tremendous opportunity to get to know your customers and to appeal to their consumer needs. You can start with the basic features, then add apps for advanced capabilities such as staff scheduling, customer management and loyalty programs, either from the start or as your business grows.</p>

And cloud technology has paved the way for truly modern POS, enabling the rapid integration of critical systems to optimize customer experiences while simultaneously driving higher margins.
