<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling. Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>
<p>Not all retailers have the same inventory needs or offer the same services to customers. You may think of this as a mobile register that may be moved to wherever the customers are, only that it offers more capabilities than a conventional cash register. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online.

<p>When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. The software comes with a powerful API, a key tool that offers retailers the freedom to integrate existing systems to achieve centralized management.

My previous experience was also in e-commerce, so I'd seen the first-hand benefits that retail technology could have when it came to time savings and sales insights.</p>
<p>Our POS comes standard with features which will improve your entire business, without the hidden cost. Build Recipes: make recipes and get information about their nutritional value to prepare excellent menus and manage your food costs well. The only negative to implementing a new restaurant management system is the training time and challenge of learning new software.

<p>However, ShopKeep has a strong set of features that makes it suitable for smaller, quick-service restaurants. Software is a huge differentiator when it comes to purchasing a restaurant point of sale system. For example, it includes bar tab management, campaign capabilities, inventory tracking and industry app integration. Since 2008, ShopKeep has been helping quick-service restaurants with their management needs.</p>
<p>For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases. POS systems record each time you check out a customer and automatically deduct the purchased item from your inventory list, which is maintained on the systems' hard drive. With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.</p>
<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
