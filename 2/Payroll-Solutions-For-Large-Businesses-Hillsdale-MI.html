<p>Using point of sale software in any retail situation has numerous benefits for the retailer as well as the customer. Clover POS is a great choice for stores that want to start taking online orders, but already have a website. Point of sale represents the area where retail businesses conduct their most intensive data entry. A countertop POS station typically includes a tablet and stand, receipt printer, and cash drawer You will also need a credit card terminal or card reader. The open source community has created an outstanding Free POS System for retail stores and restaurants.</p>

And while features like loyalty or marketing may not even be on your radar, you may find that implementing the tools that come with your chosen POS can significantly increase sales. Handheld scanners and wireless scanners have increased efficiency levels at point of sale to a large extent, and customers no longer have to queue up for many minutes while the cashier checks out their items one by one and comes up with the bill in a long and laborious process.</p>
