<p>Nowadays point of sale bar code scanners are an absolute necessity in any retail business. There are also open-source POS software programs that are maintained by online volunteers and sometimes offer a clunkier experience. Features: Dine-in and QSR features, Table Management, User Defined Interface, Multiple Payment Options, Employee Management. Well, the truth is, you need a systematic approach if you intend to sort through the overwhelming pile of POS systems , and select the most suitable one for your coffee shop or food truck business.</p>
<p>The other consideration, when discussing payment processing and POS systems for bars, is the ability to accept all payment types.
