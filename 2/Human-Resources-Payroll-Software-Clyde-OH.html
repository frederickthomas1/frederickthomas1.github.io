<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality. When it come to the actual POS hardware, you need to make sure it is compatible with the software, and that the various pieces of hardware such as the barcode scanner, cash register, and credit card reader, are compatible. Franpos, formerly iConnect, is a cloud-based franchise POS system that works with businesses in the beauty, retail and quick-service restaurant industries.</p>

<p>This high-end system helps restaurants improve and grow their business. In addition to monthly software costs, the hardware costs are a one-time fixed cost that starts at $799.
