<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Empower your stores to play a new, expanded role in today's omnichannel reality and dramatically simplify your IT infrastructure requirements with Openbravo web and cloud-based retail POS system. Lightspeed Retail POS system users outside of the US, as well as Lightspeed Restaurant POS users around the world, do not currently have access to Lightspeed Payments. The Lavu Restaurant Point-of-Sale Station Kit costs $850 and it comes with an Epson M30 receipt printer, an iDynamo credit card reader, a cash drawer, and an iPad.</p>
<p>Intuitive inventory management and ordering tools save time and money, while dynamic scheduling tools help you ensure you have the right amount of staff in-house at all times. One cool benefit of POS software is that it can build individual profiles of all your customers and track their purchase history and shopping habits. They go above and beyond payment processing by automating all the critical management tasks, hence streamlining business operations as well as communication.</p>
<p>Once you've examined your business requirements, it's time to start exploring which POS solutions can meet your needs. Whether you run a restaurant or retail store, find the right POS systems for your small business. These are some of the feature we are providing in our Bar & Restaurant POS (Point Of Sale) system. Talech Register is a cloud-based retail solution that offers point-of-sale(POS), inventory and customer management, and analytics.</p>

<p>Lightspeed Retail POS has a bit of clunky user interface, but it has all the features that most smaller retailers will be looking for in a point of sale solution. As you evaluate POS systems, you need to look at the costs, terms and features for each part of the system: software, hardware and payment processing. It's also easy to open and close tabs for customers by simply swiping their credit card through the system.</p>
<p>The company offers POS solutions for retailers and restaurants. Synchronize your online and retail customers. There's an option for remote management of the POS, too. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out. It's fully customizable and suitable for all types of food establishments, such as full-service and quick-service restaurants, cafes, bakeries, bars, and nightclubs.</p>

<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
