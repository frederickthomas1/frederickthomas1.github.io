<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system has a solid customer information system, which comes in handy when you need to maintain conversations with your customers, as well as promote the business through loyalty programs like gift cards. Infor POS helps operators in hotels, food services, restaurants, and other hospitality organizations control incoming data from multiple revenue centers. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers.</p>

Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
