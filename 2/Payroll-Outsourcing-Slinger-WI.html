<p>Point-of-sale options available to businesses range from simple mobile payment processors to those that can manage large multi-location businesses. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>More than simply a way to take orders and ring up sales, a POS system gives you total control over every important operational aspect of your restaurant. This POS system gives the owner features like inventory and sales tracking, monitoring products, and menu items, and generating reports. Today we're using Retail Pro in 350 stores worldwide. They can handle numerous kinds of payments and communicate well with back-end accounting software.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
