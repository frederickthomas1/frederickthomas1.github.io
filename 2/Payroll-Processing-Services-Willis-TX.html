<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online. Remember that, like most other business solutions, a POS system should be able to reliably and efficiently address your retail business requirements. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>

Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
