<p>From traditional to mobile, HP is reinventing the customer experience with technology solutions that empower employees and engage customers. Point-of-sale software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that give them the ability to track the most popular products and determine what products they should market based on their customers' shopping preferences. A credit card is easily read by the machine and the sale immediately sent to be approved. The biggest change in point-of-sale over the past few years are the affordable options available for small, or even micro, businesses available.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>System is hosted online, i.e. data are stored on your POS provider's internet servers, enabling you to access it from any computer browser. The software itself requires hardware components like an iPad or tablet for android OS, cash drawers, card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, and other add-ons to offer the full point of sale experience. Hence, Inventory systems are designed so that managers can order right product at the right time, in the right quantity from the right vendor and at the right price.</p>
