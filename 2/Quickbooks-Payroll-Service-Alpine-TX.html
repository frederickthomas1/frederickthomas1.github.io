<p>See what's selling and what's not with detailed sales and inventory reports. Save time by integrating Kounta with your payment terminal, accounting software, staffing tools, loyalty programs, and more. A huge area of opportunity for restaurants and bars is accurately calculating variance (also known as shrinkage and loss) and lowering it. Bar inventory management software has up-to-date inventory. Like most of the leading bars and restaurants, you probably allow your customers to tip their servers.</p>
