<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the processâ€”having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.

The best restaurant POS systems are also cost-effective, well reviewed, easy to use, and come with a professional customer support team.</p>

Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window.
