<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>These portable systems give you the flexibility to process payments right at the point of sale instead of making customers wait in line. If delivery is a significant portion of your business, you'll need a restaurant POS system that specializes in delivery management. A point of sale (POS) is a combination of software and hardware that a business owner needs to run transactions. However, what sets Square apart from most POS systems is that it comes with stellar hardware and software options that are completely free.</p>
<p>The modern design allows customers to view your menu, place orders, and pay, without any wait time. Poorly implemented systems are one of the leading causes of credit card data compromises. The superior inventory management ensures on-time low-stock alerts, effective planning of the waste management and real-time information about the cost and profit per drink. The right POS and retail management software will give you the functionality you need to grow your business.</p>
