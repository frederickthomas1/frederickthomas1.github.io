<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>

Tableside service helps restaurants reduce or fully eliminate the constant travel by servers between tables and a terminal.

<p>Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.
