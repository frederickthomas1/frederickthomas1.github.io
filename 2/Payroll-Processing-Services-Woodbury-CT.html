<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner.</p>
<p>Its solutions include POS software, traditional POS hardware systems with touchscreen monitors, and mobile POS systems that use tablets. You have secure access to your data anywhere across multiple stores, and new features are always a free update away. And to top it off, Square for Restaurant comes with all the fundamental features you'd want from a restaurant POS system. With this plan you will receive inventory management for up to 1,000 products, sales analytics, the ability to send digital receipts, employee and customer management features, plus mobile connectivity and the ability to sell offline.</p>
