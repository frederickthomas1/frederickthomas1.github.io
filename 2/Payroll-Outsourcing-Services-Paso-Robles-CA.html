CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations.

The starter plan is best suited for cafes, standard plan is good for fast casual restaurants, and pro plan is best for full-service restaurants.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
