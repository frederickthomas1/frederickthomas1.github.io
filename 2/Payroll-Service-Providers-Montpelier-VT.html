Our POS terminals speed up your daily operations and enhance your customer service by automatically calculating offers, promotion prices and special prices for loyal customers. TouchSystems understands that reality and helps people to discover those tools, whether they be self-service kiosks, digital signage or point of sale (POS) terminals.</p>
<p>With any of these restaurant management systems, a restaurant or any other food-serving establishment is sure to see a marked increase in its efficiency, productivity and in turn sales. And, with Retail Pro, you can collect and act on the data you need to drive more sales. The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system.

<p>Since then, we have seamlessly rolled the system out to each new store we open, with shop floor staff as well as the management team finding it an invaluable tool which gives an accurate daily picture of the business which, when used to its full potential, can see a positive impact on not only customer service, but also profit. In business, the customer data is helpful for advertising as it offers insights regarding which customer would be paying attention in the sale.</p>
<p>Prominent features include omnichannel delivery, integrated POS, cost control, kiosks, and yes, even kitchen management. As an example, for a small business with one POS machine, we estimate you'll pay around $1,250 for hardware and about $69 per month for a software subscription. While the word inventory may instill fear in many managers, most admit, it directly affects a restaurant making money. Repeat customers are the lifeblood of any retail business.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of any Point of Sale System setup by any store is to improve sales and profits by keeping track of all the products being sold or purchased at the retail store.
