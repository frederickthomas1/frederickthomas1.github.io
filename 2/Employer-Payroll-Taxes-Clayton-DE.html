<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>Restaurant point of sale systems cost any from the price of a daily cup of coffee to a daily surf-n-turf dinner.
