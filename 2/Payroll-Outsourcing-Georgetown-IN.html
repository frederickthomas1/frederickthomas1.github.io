<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling.

Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table.

Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis. On the surface, most point of sale systems promise the same basic functionality: The ability to accept payments, track sales, manage inventory, and keep track of customer data. There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>

<p>Improved efficiency means higher customer satisfaction, lower costs and higher sales. Understand what items you should keep on your menu, how many sales come from your new promotions, how your new bartender performs, and more. But like retail sales training, don't see the purchase as a cost but as an investment. It provides recipe management and food costing, purchase management, stock management and inventory, along with a powerful reporting capability.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>

This history means that ACE Retail has one of the longest list of POS features in the industry.</p>
<p>Other functions of a POS system are to maintain sales information for reporting purposes as well as customer information for receivables management, marketing and specific buying analysis. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to.</p>
<p>Serving bars and restaurants of all sizes, Ordyx POS is a state of the art, hybrid, point of sale system. Your business database will be hosted on secure servers that provide real-time backup.

<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
