<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling. Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb.

<p>This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp. Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis. On the surface, most point of sale systems promise the same basic functionality: The ability to accept payments, track sales, manage inventory, and keep track of customer data. There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
<p>POS software is installed at the very place the main transaction occurs at a retail store.

Pro shops, as well as any retail business will benefit from TallySales.

Bottom Line: ShopKeep offers the point-of-sale (POS) system features that most small businesses will want without overwhelming them; however, the cost of add-ons can add up.</p>
<p>Improved efficiency means higher customer satisfaction, lower costs and higher sales. Understand what items you should keep on your menu, how many sales come from your new promotions, how your new bartender performs, and more. But like retail sales training, don't see the purchase as a cost but as an investment. It provides recipe management and food costing, purchase management, stock management and inventory, along with a powerful reporting capability.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>

Taking customer payments is easy with Square's credit card readers and point-of-sale mobile app, which works with most Android and Apple devices; for example, many Square users run their businesses with iPads. This history means that ACE Retail has one of the longest list of POS features in the industry.</p>
<p>Other functions of a POS system are to maintain sales information for reporting purposes as well as customer information for receivables management, marketing and specific buying analysis. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to.</p>
<p>Serving bars and restaurants of all sizes, Ordyx POS is a state of the art, hybrid, point of sale system. Your business database will be hosted on secure servers that provide real-time backup. Based on my experience with the POS solution, I'd say its robust features should comfortably support basically any type of small or medium-sized business in the hospitality industry. Focus gives restaurants a competitive edge by providing simple, yet powerful restaurant management solutions.</p>
<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
