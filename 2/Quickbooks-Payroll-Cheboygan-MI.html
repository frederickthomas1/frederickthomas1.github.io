Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d'accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online.
