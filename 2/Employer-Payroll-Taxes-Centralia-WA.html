<p>Restaurant POS systems should also protect against any possible inside, employee theft.

The point of sale offers a tremendous opportunity to get to know your customers and to appeal to their consumer needs.

<p>Perhaps the most valuable way POS systems help you gain better control of your business is through their reporting features. One capability they'll look for is a unified commerce platform that allows them to offer customers a seamless shopping experience that spans in-person, online and mobile channels.

Cash registers are not as evolved as using a POS system and lack many of the functions and features of a modern day point of sale system like Square Point of Sale A cash register could be considered a point of sale solution technically, however, for our definitions, we will be focusing on point-of-sale machines (aka POS terminals) that involve both software and hardware.</p>
