<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With older POS systems, managers had a lot more workload. Much like online ordering, customers are interested in on-demand services that reduce wait times. Lightspeed makes it easy to build a customized menu, take and manage guest orders, and facilitate multiple payment methods.</p>

It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
