<p>Many point of sale systems offer retail-specific features, including robust inventory management, purchase ordering, CMR, loyalty programs, eCommerce, and much more. A POS system is used to conduct sales at brick & mortar and eCommerce stores. With Smart Tax the customer pays the sales tax on bar sales with food items. But with plans that start at $69 per month, you get in-depth inventory, customer, and accounting management in a professional and impressive package.</p>

You will know best what items you might need more than one of. Having staff carrying around iPads can make your business look more professional and save time with customer queries but there is, obviously, a cost premium per device.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
