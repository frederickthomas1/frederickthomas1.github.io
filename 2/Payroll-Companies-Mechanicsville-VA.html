<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>From inventory management, custom barcode printing, and purchase order creation, the platform has all the features you need to handle the sales process and implement fast checkouts. The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Focus POS enables your business to operate without interruption as you manage tables, communicate orders to the kitchen, process payments—and maximize table turnover.</p>
<p>There is POS software specific to almost every kind of business imaginable - hotels, retail, restaurant, auto mechanic, etc. See how easy it can be to use an integrated POS system and accounting software with the SumUp card reader and Debitoor connection.
