<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>There is usually a form of payment involved to complete the transaction, such as credit cards, cash, debit cards, EMV, and mobile payments.

<p>Before choosing from the many great POS systems for restaurants and bars , evaluate your business's needs and assess how each option fulfills those needs. A POS transaction is the moment where a transaction is finalized or the moment where a customer tenders payment in exchange for goods and services. With customer resource management (CRM) solutions, restaurateurs can use customer data to deploy email marketing and influence loyalty programs, and online ordering.</p>
<p>See what's selling and what's not with detailed sales and inventory reports. Save time by integrating Kounta with your payment terminal, accounting software, staffing tools, loyalty programs, and more. A huge area of opportunity for restaurants and bars is accurately calculating variance (also known as shrinkage and loss) and lowering it. Bar inventory management software has up-to-date inventory. Like most of the leading bars and restaurants, you probably allow your customers to tip their servers.</p>
<p>A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. There is also a table management module, a sales reports module, and other features like top-tracking. Imagine restaurant POS systems that can tell which customers are in which seat at which table, and charge them for their food individually and automatically without a single credit card passing hands.</p>
<p>In addition to the main menus, they can enter pre-set preparation instructions for the service bartender, or use free text if necessary. Only NCR Silver, which is one of the products covered in this POS system review, charges a one-time price for their software. In some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via payment terminals Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter.</p>

<p>Prominent features include omnichannel delivery, integrated POS, cost control, kiosks, and yes, even kitchen management. As an example, for a small business with one POS machine, we estimate you'll pay around $1,250 for hardware and about $69 per month for a software subscription. While the word inventory may instill fear in many managers, most admit, it directly affects a restaurant making money. Repeat customers are the lifeblood of any retail business.</p>
<p>Inventory Management: Having a POS system that specifically helps you manage your retail inventory can be a lifesaver Some of these features can include purchase order management, low stock alerts, and the ability to transfer stock across multiple stores to name a few. The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business.
