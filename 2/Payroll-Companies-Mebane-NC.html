<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. You'll probably want a traditional set-up with a full-service POS if you have a retail store , salon, dry cleaner, or quick-serve restaurant Consider countertop POS systems, which are available in various sizes and take less space than traditional cash registers. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud.

Point of sale equipment allows for effective management of these programs.

<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. POS systems can suffer from internet connectivity problems and software issues.

<p>Stay on top of everything with clear sales reports, inventory management and staff performance tracking. Get real-time visibility into all inventory held across the company, allowing customers to purchase products regardless of location in a single transaction, including cash-and-carry, ship-to-home or pickup in another store. Although many companies are going to credit card-only models, you may want to invest in a system that allows cash transactions.</p>
<p>A single POS terminal may be enough for small and new businesses, but you may want to add more if your business is busy and you need to reduce wait times. As your small business grows, so can your point of sales system. Track their hours, sales performance, overtime hours, and set special permissions for each user. It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software.</p>
<p>As the sales of gift cards is increasing every year, your POS system must have the capability to manage those as well. Inventory Management : Restaurant POS software makes inventory management easier and more accurate. A multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets.</p>
