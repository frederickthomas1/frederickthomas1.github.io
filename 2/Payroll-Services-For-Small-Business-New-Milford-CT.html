<p>Obviously, you need to consider the cost of the POS system (including the hardware and software). Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs. Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.</p>
<p>For that reason, there are also different types of POS systems for restaurants. SWIM offers four different pricing structures, starting with a month of trialling the software to the highest plan that includes unlimited sales and inventory items.

<p>Many times it will have the MSR built in. Many large stores use mechanical keyboards which are rated for higher use than a standard consumer keyboard. Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. A cloud-based restaurant POS does both by providing an efficient system to modify menus and prices. Integration with 3rd Party Apps — businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications.</p>
