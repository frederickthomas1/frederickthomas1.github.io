<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. You'll probably want a traditional set-up with a full-service POS if you have a retail store , salon, dry cleaner, or quick-serve restaurant Consider countertop POS systems, which are available in various sizes and take less space than traditional cash registers. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Runs in Offline Mode: Even when you are offline, you can punch in orders and download business reports with LimeTray restaurant software. POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. The mobile POS can be used to serve customers everywhere - alternatively, there is a self-order menu that lets customers order by themselves on an iPad at their table. Yet, because the CRM database is integrated with the POS software, the information stored in the database is even more valuable.</p>
<p>We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage. Inventory management — Linking back-of-house and front-of-house functions is crucial, and many restaurant POS systems include inventory management features that allow you to be on top of sourcing and purchasing. Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.</p>
