<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. All in all, offering NFC, EMV, and magstripe payments guarantees you will be able to accommodate your customers no matter their payment method.</p>
<p>Cloud-based POS platform that lets restaurants facilitate workflow processes with inventory tracking, guest management and more. Data analytics are a dynamic part of modern POS systems. And while features like loyalty or marketing may not even be on your radar, you may find that implementing the tools that come with your chosen POS can significantly increase sales. Handheld scanners and wireless scanners have increased efficiency levels at point of sale to a large extent, and customers no longer have to queue up for many minutes while the cashier checks out their items one by one and comes up with the bill in a long and laborious process.</p>
<p>Moreover, POS and restaurant management solutions out there are a dime a dozen, and cherry-picking the best isn't that simple. A POS terminal is the device that the mobile POS software runs on. With TallySoft's POS software, TallySales, your pro shop will benefit from a proven solution that provides robust functionalities at an affordability that's right for your business. Customers habitually research products online before they ever step foot in your store.</p>

<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
