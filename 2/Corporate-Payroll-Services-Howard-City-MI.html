Self-service kiosks - A large self-service kiosk can help customers serve themselves, saving your staff time. An online restaurant management system is essentially a web application that is developed to automate the daily activities of a restaurant. On top of payment processing fees, many point of sale systems will charge your business for using their software. The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software.

With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals.
