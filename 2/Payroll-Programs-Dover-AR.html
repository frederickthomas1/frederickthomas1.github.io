From ensuring that there's enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary in ensuring that your store runs smoothly. Although there is software designed specifically for bars, most point of sale systems used by restaurants can also be an excellent solution for bars.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages provided by the modern day POS systems is the help they can offer you by tracking your inventory levels. Most payment processors will send you the credit card reader for free. Although a POS system is an essential tool for any retail store, it shouldn't be the only one you have in your arsenal. Whether you're a sommelier or a barback , learning everything you can about restaurant and bar technology will ensure you end up with tools and solutions that fit perfectly with work style, business model, or management style.</p>

<p>The platform comes equipped with a robust inventory management feature allowing you to customize categories and settings. Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports. With inventory management, you can change menu details, like name, quantity, and price, in real-time.</p>
<p>Before choosing one, you need to consider the numbers of departments and terminals, the work-load, the modes of payments, the type of computer operating system and database, whether accessible online or not, the hardware part of the system etc. National Retail Solutions' POS+ system is designed for small, independent retail stores. The days of receipt pads and cash registers are sadly gone, and today's most successful restaurants rely on state of the art POS systems to increase their profit margins and keep their account books in the black.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
