<p>It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. The only major complaint with QuickBooks is that it isn't recommended for many basic types of businesses, including full-service restaurants and retail stores with brick-and-mortar locations. There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically.</p>
<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>

Its POS system is built primarily for restaurants and other food-based businesses, though retail stores can also use it. It is affordable, has no lengthy contract requirement, is compatible with third-party POS hardware and has a good selection of features.

<p>As the sales of gift cards is increasing every year, your POS system must have the capability to manage those as well. Inventory Management : Restaurant POS software makes inventory management easier and more accurate. A multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets.</p>
