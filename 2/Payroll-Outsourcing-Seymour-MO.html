<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>Motivate customers to visit your bar again by rewarding them with bonus points using the loyalty program. Don't miss this opportunity to reach out to your customers with a timely delivery to build brand loyalty among your customers. Good inventory control means balancing the expectations of your customers and your bankers, so you have to avoid being either under or over stocked. It suits inventory-based retailers, customizing the way they conduct ecommerce.</p>
<p>Many a times the users might prefer to make partial payments- some by using Gift card (GC) and remaining by Cash. Plus, never miss a sale again with offline credit card payments. You get to manage your retail business using a unified interface, which means you can instantly accept payments from multiple channels (credit cards, online payments, etc.) without worrying about third-party fees and restrictions and saving you a lot of time.</p>
