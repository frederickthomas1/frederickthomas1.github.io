<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
<p>Mobility - mPOS allows you to be mobile” where you can accept orders and payments at a vendor show, or take orders on the floor of your restaurant or retail store. A retail business's point of sale largely defines a customer's shopping experience. The Restaurant Point of Sale software has come a long way from only billing to complete restaurant management. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d'accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.</p>

The software has become a staple for many small businesses requiring a fully functional POS that does not break the bank.</p>
