Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction.</p>
<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste.

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the visitor's computer or mobile device. Retail stores require different types of POS equipment. You may only need a simple system to complete business transactions, or you may require a full-service option that also monitors inventory, tracks employee tips and integrates with other applications.</p>
<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
