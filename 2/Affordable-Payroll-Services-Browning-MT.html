<p>Point-of-sale options available to businesses range from simple mobile payment processors to those that can manage large multi-location businesses. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>Mobility - mPOS allows you to be mobile” where you can accept orders and payments at a vendor show, or take orders on the floor of your restaurant or retail store. A retail business's point of sale largely defines a customer's shopping experience. The Restaurant Point of Sale software has come a long way from only billing to complete restaurant management. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d'accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>

Some systems offer functionality which is close to that offered by CMS packages; for example, sending emails to customers to thank them for sales, advertise bargains or offer coupons, and offer other loyalty perks.</p>
<p>A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. The right POS system can streamline every operation of your restaurant, bar, or cafe, from orders and payments to your entire ingredient inventory. Depending on the needs of your business after you have achieved the minimum functionality, there are some other features you might want to look for such as the ability for customers to use two forms of payment for surge pricing, gift cards, or special pricing (for special customers or sales) to allow for returns.</p>
