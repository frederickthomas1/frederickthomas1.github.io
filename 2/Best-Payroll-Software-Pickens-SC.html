<p>Although each business is unique, the typical POS hardware you need for your retail business includes a tablet and stand, cash drawer, barcode scanner, and receipt printer. To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity. It would be ideal to run the new system in tandem with the old one for a week or more, but this is a luxury that many stores cannot indulge in. The POS system should start providing useful information about inventory control and customers after a month of full-time use.</p>

With the eHopper POS all-in-one business management system, you can cut back time spent on daily operations and back office tasks and promote efficiency within your business. Stores can have a store server and the POS devices can be linked either to the store server or directly to iVend Enterprise over the Internet.</p>
