<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow.

Combined, the tools are particularly handy for streamlining the management of multiple restaurant locations.</p>

Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
