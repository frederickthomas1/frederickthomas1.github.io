<p>When choosing a retail store for shopping needs, shoppers choose where to go based on a number of factors. Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.</p>
<p>Restaurant point of sale systems cost any from the price of a daily cup of coffee to a daily surf-n-turf dinner. Having a POS system that accepts several types of payments establishes credibility with customers as soon as they walk in your store. Designed for an iPAD, this POS assists jewellers with sales processing and the management of their business.

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
