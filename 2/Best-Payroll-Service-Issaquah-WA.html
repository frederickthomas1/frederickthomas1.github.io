<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>As a business owner, use Yelp to communicate with your customers and text them directly. It's predicted that eighty percent of all enterprise (and mission-critical) workloads will move to the cloud by 2025 ( Top 10 Cloud Predictions ). To this end, many retailers are seeking a cloud-based strategy to meet employee and customer needs. Our tailor-made menu layouts, buttons, and graphics are all designed around your business and set up with the specific user in mind, whether it's management, service staff, or your customer.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>

Built specifically for restaurants, Toast brings together many solutions from integrated online ordering and loyalty programs to payroll and labor and sales reporting, all on a mobile, cloud-based POS system.</p>
<p>Having these options is mostly a no-brainer these days because you have access to all your sales and programming data online remotely or through an App. That's because many consumers are moving their payment information into virtual credit card apps like Google Pay and Apple Pay.
