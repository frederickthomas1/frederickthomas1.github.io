<p>A Point of Sale (POS) system is indispensable for any type of retail business. QuickBooksPOS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as ring up sales and inventory tracking. The software helps you manage your inventory, customers, and staff, and it includes loyalty tools and a timeclock app. We know your business is all about repeat customers. TouchBistro's restaurant POS system features can accommodate small, mid-sized, and large restaurant businesses. PHP Point of Sale can be used by retailers, grocery stores, bakeries, coffee shops and museums.</p>
<p>As a business owner, use Yelp to communicate with your customers and text them directly. It's predicted that eighty percent of all enterprise (and mission-critical) workloads will move to the cloud by 2025 ( Top 10 Cloud Predictions ). To this end, many retailers are seeking a cloud-based strategy to meet employee and customer needs.

<p>Substitutions, drink recipe lists, price scheduling, tab management, and split inventory for liquor pours are just a few features to look for in bar POS software. Another important aspect of POS software is broad support for new payment systems. Lightspeed register terminals are iPad-based and provide access to the backend business management system.

<p>Lightspeed Retail POS has a bit of clunky user interface, but it has all the features that most smaller retailers will be looking for in a point of sale solution. As you evaluate POS systems, you need to look at the costs, terms and features for each part of the system: software, hardware and payment processing. It's also easy to open and close tabs for customers by simply swiping their credit card through the system.</p>
<p>That feature is a key for busy restaurants: Toast Go also means servers can run customer credit cards right at the table and have the receipt emailed to them. If all you need is to have a total amount of cash in the drawer that sometimes matches to the amount of sales shown you probably don't need a point of sale system.
