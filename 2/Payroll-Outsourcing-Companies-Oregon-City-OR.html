<p>Some of the POS systems mentioned on this page were designed specifically for restaurants. Nobly's iPad POS system is an affordable Point of Sale, backed by a powerful Back Office & award-winning customer support. Ability to manage accounts payable, including support for both balance forward (for example, credit cards) and open item accounts, and the ability to reconcile accounts with monthly statements. Because of the importance of accurate data capture in sophisticated point-of-sale systems, retailers are increasingly turning to scanning as an alternative to error-prone keypunch entry." Indeed, scanning became a ubiquitous feature in many of the nation's most modestly-sized retail outlets during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Aside from the POS system, it features customizable menu management. POS systems have given a huge boost to many of the retail business owners, because they not only speed up payment services, but also give real-time information about inventory and customers. Better still, it wraps up all the needed features into an easy-to-understand interface: Sales, billing, inventory, layout management, analytics reports and loyalty programs are included.</p>

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure. In restaurants, the ability to track ingredients in real-time and set automatic stock alerts is extremely useful, while, for retail establishments, some systems come with the ability to create your own purchase orders and track inventory across multiple locations.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest issue facing restaurants is inventory management.

Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system.

<p>If the sound POS system is connected to the computerized accounting system, then the user can clear credit cards, record transactions manage sales, and collect taxes quickly.
