<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations.

More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of POS companies available online, and the cost and prices will vary depending on the type of business environment you have and how many terminals you will need. Most POS systems have integrations with other technologies, like accounting, inventory management, your website CMS, staff management, and marketing.
