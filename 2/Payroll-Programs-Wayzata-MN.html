<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>

<p>It cuts down on paperwork by automating the reconciliation of cash and card payments. TouchBistro is created with the foodservice business in mind, which is why it's among the most widely-used POS platforms by coffee shops, bars, fine dining, delis, restaurants, food trucks, and other similar shops. Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service.</p>
<p>Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them. As evident as the benefits of a POS system are, we found that 56 percent of single-store retailers are still not using one Instead, we found, many are still using a combination of manual methods, cash registers, QuickBooks and Excel for bookkeeping. It's essential that your bar POS enhances your ability to serve customers and complete orders; it shouldn't be a hindrance to your ability to fulfill customer requests quickly.</p>

Square Point of Sale, our pick for best overall POS system, has an excellent all-in-one solution for taking payments through stationary or mobile devices.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

<p>Some sales people need to be reminded that this is your choice and that you will choose the system which is right for your business. Ultimately, retailers must create an efficient checkout process, minimize wait times, and increase productivity to reduce operational costs and support their global business across all channels. Our point of sale system address the challenges of both small, independent aspirational retailers & large multi-store retail chains.</p>

The real time tracking makes it possible to track food usage patterns, minimizing shortages and reducing instances of over ordering. Despite boasting such an impressive set of features, this restaurant POS system will only cost you about $105 a month.</p>
<p>The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. The software window has several columns such as items bought, quantity of each item, sales taxes, total payable amount, amount tendered and balance for the customer. Square POS has become one of the most widely used point of sale systems out thereâ€”and for good reason.</p>
<p>provides credit card processing services and equipment to retailers, restaurants and online merchants. It also makes it easy to track inventory, sales, timesheets, and more. Many bar owners look for other helpful POS software features, like a fast user interface, tab transfer and selection, tip accounting, and surcharge and cash discount capabilities.

<p>However, POS software is quite scalable and modules can be added for accounting, inventory and even customer relationship management (CRM.) Value priced software choices are available that can give a small shop owner some of the tools the large fortune 500 retailers use. For nearly 30 years, Focus has provided restaurant point of sale software that helps businesses run successfully. If your store uses credit and debit cards, then the credit card swipe is an essential ingredient to business success.</p>
<p>Such systems make quick customer assistance and remote inventory assessment for size, color etc. With an established means of sales control, your business growth can't outpace your ability as an owner to track profit levels against your financial obligations. You can visualize sales and get analytical reports and track inventory for effectively growing your business. But things can always go wrong, especially when you're dealing with back-office functions such as inventory or personnel management.</p>
<p>In many ways, point of sale systems created for the restaurant industry are very similar to retail POS systems. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, then using Shopify POS for in-store transactions is a no-brainer. Modern retail is online, in-store and mobile, so get the point of sale system that takes you where you need to go.</p>
