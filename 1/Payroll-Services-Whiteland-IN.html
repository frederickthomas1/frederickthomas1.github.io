<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. In addition to POS services, Habortouch also offers access to online reservations, employee management systems, and a customer database. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong. We can help you with any type of point of sale pos software to satiate your needs. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success.</p>
<p>Designed specifically for wine, beer, and liquor stores, this POS software has inventory and customer management tools, more than 70 reports, and a built-in timeclock. One of the newer restaurant POS on the market, Rezku weighs in heavy with an easy-to-use, modern and sleek interface. It is part of the Shopify ecommerce suite that lets you manage a business from everywhere, including tracking inventory across channels, accepting any form of payment, applying discounts, emailing customers their receipts, and processing refunds.</p>

As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>
