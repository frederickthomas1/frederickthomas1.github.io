<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>And that's precisely where a POS system for restaurants comes in. It's the one application you need in your food truck, coffee shop, fast food service outlet, or bar to streamline the entire business. In store and eCommerce packages for Cumulus Retail are available in scalable versions so as you grow, your Point Of Sale software and eCommerce system growth with you. So, here's the ultimate guide for the best POS system for restaurants in 2020.</p>

Revel Systems has built-in timecards that let you track your employees' hours accurately.</p>
