<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Runs in Offline Mode: Even when you are offline, you can punch in orders and download business reports with LimeTray restaurant software. POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. The mobile POS can be used to serve customers everywhere - alternatively, there is a self-order menu that lets customers order by themselves on an iPad at their table. Yet, because the CRM database is integrated with the POS software, the information stored in the database is even more valuable.</p>
<p>Whether they are standing at the bar or chilling on the terrasse, your customers want the full experience. Managing the various specials and happy hour promotions, as well as multiple menus in your business, should be easy and convenient. Revel Systems is a robust point of sale (POS) and business management platform designed to maximize security, stability, ease-of-use, and service delivery.
