However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. A cloud-based POS system, Lightspeed has a restaurant-specific design that streamlines hospitality functions for the manager and customer.</p>
<p>Perhaps a retail store uses touch technology when they check out a customer at the department store. The business owners only have to download an app and create an account for a mobile POS system.

Lightspeed makes it easy to build a customized menu, take and manage guest orders, and facilitate multiple payment methods.</p>
