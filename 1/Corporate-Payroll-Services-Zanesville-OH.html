<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account.

Retail 4.0 will see retailers integrating their offline and online sales via IoT-enabled POS such that customers can shop online and pick up in the store or vice versa. We build custom software for small business including stock control, retail barcode systems, restaurant point of sale (pos),internet cyber cafes, internet shops, e-commerce websites, online shops , hosting etc.</p>
<p>Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. These features include the ability for customers to use two types of payment, for example, or to allow for returns, special pricing (for sales or special customers), gift cards, and surge pricing. There are many different types of point-of-sale systems for each kind of business, so we've outlined some key points to consider as you shop.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>It helps you manage restaurants, Mini Bar, Spa, Travel desk and many more. Square provides feedback through intelligent reports and analytics, giving you insights on your operations and a real-time situation on your sales, customers, and more. For instance, POS systems for the restaurant business can enhance customer loyalty and retention by being used for promotions via email or sms. Your bartenders can chat customers up, but they also need to keep those customers buying for you to be successful.</p>
