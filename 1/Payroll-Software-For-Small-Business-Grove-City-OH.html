<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. Hike is a leading retail POS software in the cloud with everything you need to run & grow your business. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails.
