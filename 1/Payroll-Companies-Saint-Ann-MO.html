<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling. Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>

This enables your customers to shop virtually anywhere as the software integrates processes and channels to deliver dependable shopping experience across all your channels, letting customers select store to home or store to store delivery.</p>
<p>In-store customers account for 50% of all eCommerce activity, research by Salesforce found, so closing the online-offline gap is critical for customer experience. POS Nation is an all-in-one Point of Sale (POS) system built to the specific needs of restaurants, retailers, and specialty stores like pizzerias, tobacco shops, liquor stores, and specialty groceries. The POS provider should be able to offer warranty, provide excellent technical support, references, full assistance with integrating the retail POS software to your business, and have the latest features and up-to-date software.</p>

<p>It is an active restaurant management system that helps you to maintain information privacy, maximize customer value by analysis of statistics, keeps you updated with the logistics & inventory requirements at all levels and restaurant chains and helps you achieve competitive advantages through custom reporting and business intelligence reports. If you sell on the go, you can get by with a mobile credit card dongle that attaches to your smart phone and allows you to process payment via your POS app.</p>
<p>In both cases, the POS system will allow your business to accept card payments and handle a variety of back-office functions. The POSsible POS software is simple and efficient for our business.

<p>Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.

For retail stores, winning shoppers' loyalty is accomplished when their needs are met and their shopping experience leaves them satisfied that they received quality products at competitive prices and great customer service.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Its mobile implementation is equally capable with a one-touch payment feature to support a responsive build and superior micro-moments technology to drive your brand and actual growth of sales. Avoid long lines with Shopify POS by accepting payments from anywhere in the store. Many POS providers also offer multiple software plans, with higher cost plans leading to lower payment processing fees.</p>
