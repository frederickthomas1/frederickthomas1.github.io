<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. Retail businesses can use the system for both stationary and mobile devices. The POS hardware costs include tablets, monitors, card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, and self- service kiosks.
