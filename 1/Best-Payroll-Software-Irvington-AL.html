<p>The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers. In fact, research shows that more than half (52 percent) of retailers are arming store associates with mobile technologyâ€”and another 26 percent plan to do the same. Tillpoint is the multi-award-winning POS & Restaurant Management System. Mobile POS is now available that keeps POS users from being tied down to a specific location in a store.</p>

<p>Identifying your point-of-sale needs can be as easy as finding out what your competitors (or other businesses similar to yours) are using or as difficult as performing an in-depth study of every transaction you process. Its design team, which is made up of former waiters, bartenders and restaurant managers, has tweaked the system based on workers' needs. Research has shown repeatedly that errors are dozens of times more likely with manually calculated balances as opposed to those derived at automatically by software.</p>

The company says that its POS system has more than 200 features, including table management, kitchen processes, dashboard reports and a built-in CRM. However, it lacks several features, such as mobile solutions, which modern businesses will look for.</p>
<p>Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control, and these features are typical of almost all modern ePOS systems.

With Dallas POS, we only offer our customers the future of affordable and simple point of sale software and hardware.

<p>Increased Employee Customer Interaction: Because POS systems are efficient at reducing the amount of time employees have to spend doing business operation tasks, they will have more time to spend with the customer. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>However, several affordable, cloud-based till systems for small retailers are available today, whether it's for an off-licence, gift shop, florist, bike shop or other independent store. The primary operational use of the Point Of Sale system is to speed up the billing process for the customers at the store.

Modern restaurant POS systems provide a platform that sits at the heart of any food and beverage operation, large or small, helping to enhance the customer experience and streamline business operations. Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list.</p>
