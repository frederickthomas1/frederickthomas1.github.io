<p>From traditional to mobile, HP is reinventing the customer experience with technology solutions that empower employees and engage customers. Point-of-sale software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that give them the ability to track the most popular products and determine what products they should market based on their customers' shopping preferences. A credit card is easily read by the machine and the sale immediately sent to be approved. The biggest change in point-of-sale over the past few years are the affordable options available for small, or even micro, businesses available.</p>
<p>Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Easier payment options : When payments of the checks are as easy as swiping or tapping a card, not only do the staffs not have to worry about keeping tab over the patrons upon serving the checks but also ensure that the patrons enjoy a hassle-free check-out after a night's merriment. The best restaurant POS systems are also cost-effective, well reviewed, easy to use, and come with a professional customer support team.</p>

Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>

Our point of sale system address the challenges of both small, independent aspirational retailers & large multi-store retail chains.</p>
<p>Aside from the POS system, it features customizable menu management. POS systems have given a huge boost to many of the retail business owners, because they not only speed up payment services, but also give real-time information about inventory and customers. Better still, it wraps up all the needed features into an easy-to-understand interface: Sales, billing, inventory, layout management, analytics reports and loyalty programs are included.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between POS systems and cash registers , but generally speaking, functionality is typically uniform across platforms in the sense that a POS machine is used to ring up sales and to accept payments.

The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>
<p>Square POS features printable sales reports, receipt printer support, barcode scanner support, digital receipts via SMS or email, adjustable taxes, tipping by percentage or custom amount, full and partial refunds and customer signature capture among others. A wide range of venues are supported: bars, bakeries, casual, fast casual, fine dining - even delivery services and online ordering, making this POS a great choice for operations that are expanding and want to meet their customers wherever they are.</p>
<p>The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. In order to open a customer tab, the bartender only needs to swipe the customer's card through the system. Square for Restaurants is particularly suited for basic quick-service coffee shops, food trucks, cafés, bars, etc. As well, retailers can offer special promotions and customer loyalty programs to promote customer loyalty and product branding.</p>
<p>Keep all the stores linked up by sharing customers, gift cards, stock and more. You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen.

<p>Another significant advantage of using a restaurant management software is the ability to send orders directly to the kitchen - this is a considerable advantage by increasing food prep time, staff efficiency, and reducing errors in the kitchen. Interactive graphs help managers understand the data collected in the software system's reporting and analytics features. A modern POS system will consist of a touchscreen computer that operates with POS software that's used to complete product orders and accept all payment types.</p>
<p>Furthermore, POS Nation not only helps its clients with customizable software but it also provides them with the right hardware and peripherals for their business. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>
<p>This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction. A lot of big box stores have wildly expensive POS solutions, some of which were custom built for their needs.</p>
