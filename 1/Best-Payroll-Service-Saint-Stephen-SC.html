<p>Point-of-sale options available to businesses range from simple mobile payment processors to those that can manage large multi-location businesses. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
