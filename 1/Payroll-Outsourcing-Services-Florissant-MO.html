<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>Through the system, you can minimize human errors that usually occur when entering sales data, so the resulting data is completely accurate. At any time shopkeeper can have a track on total sales which can be further bifurcated in cash and debit card. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages provided by the modern day POS systems is the help they can offer you by tracking your inventory levels. Most payment processors will send you the credit card reader for free. Although a POS system is an essential tool for any retail store, it shouldn't be the only one you have in your arsenal.

Aside from tableside service efficiency, the system helps you with staff management and scheduling, menu management and inventory management using iPad-accessible tools.

The intuitive and easy to use point of sale system works on mobile and desktop devices and being cloud-based, allows businesses to access key data whilst on the go.</p>
<p>For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. IPad devices provide a solution that helps eliminate order confusion, lagging service, and incomplete sales data. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer. Or log in to your mobile app and view or print sales receipt easily. Personalized engagement: Seamless customer engagement - including clienteling and case management - is at the core of our POS, providing the tools associates need to personalize interactions to drive sales and deliver exceptional in-store service.</p>

<p>This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction. A lot of big box stores have wildly expensive POS solutions, some of which were custom built for their needs.</p>
