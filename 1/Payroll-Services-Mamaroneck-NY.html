<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>
<p>Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges. Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature. Customers can explore the pay-at-table options, while the restaurant becomes flexible to accept all card types with this software easily.</p>
<p>We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage. Inventory management — Linking back-of-house and front-of-house functions is crucial, and many restaurant POS systems include inventory management features that allow you to be on top of sourcing and purchasing. Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.</p>

<p>Digital adoption — Silicon Valley is packed with early adopters who want all the options, but restaurants on the Rust Belt can stick to a more compact POS with fewer features. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not. Founded in 2004 in France, CLYO Systems creates payment and management solutions for restaurants, bars and cafés.</p>
<p>A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. The right POS system can streamline every operation of your restaurant, bar, or cafe, from orders and payments to your entire ingredient inventory. Depending on the needs of your business after you have achieved the minimum functionality, there are some other features you might want to look for such as the ability for customers to use two forms of payment for surge pricing, gift cards, or special pricing (for special customers or sales) to allow for returns.</p>
