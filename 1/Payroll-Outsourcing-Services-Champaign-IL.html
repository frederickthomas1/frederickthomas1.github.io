<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
