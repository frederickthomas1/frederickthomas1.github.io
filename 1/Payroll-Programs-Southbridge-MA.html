<p>Run the world's best retail with Vend POS software + PayPal. The good news is you can always find a different restaurant POS solution, either as a standalone product, or bundled within a larger venue management kit with multiple attractive functionalities. The ETP Omni-channel Store provides your customers a seamless experience across all your stores, e-commerce sites and other touch points. We are hardware retailers who could not find a POS solution that completely met our needs, so we developed it ourselves.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
