Retail and gaming POS solution that offers employee access controls, inventory tracking, check splitting, and loyalty cards. Our POS terminals speed up your daily operations and enhance your customer service by automatically calculating offers, promotion prices and special prices for loyal customers. TouchSystems understands that reality and helps people to discover those tools, whether they be self-service kiosks, digital signage or point of sale (POS) terminals.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>

<p>With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Let's now look at the things to consider before buying any restaurant management software for your business. If your business relies heavily on return business, then opting for a point of sale that offers this feature could seriously up your customer return rate.
