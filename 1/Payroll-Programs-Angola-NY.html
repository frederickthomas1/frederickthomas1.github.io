Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature.

<p>Before choosing from the many great POS systems for restaurants and bars , evaluate your business's needs and assess how each option fulfills those needs. A POS transaction is the moment where a transaction is finalized or the moment where a customer tenders payment in exchange for goods and services. With customer resource management (CRM) solutions, restaurateurs can use customer data to deploy email marketing and influence loyalty programs, and online ordering.</p>
<p>Some bar POS systems are also known to integrate a time clock module with tip tracking. Either your retail business runs in a single, or multiple store locations, it deserves to run Simply. A great system also allows nightclub owners and managers to see exactly how their business is performing in real-time, from anywhere. Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough.

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminalâ€”it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
