<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp. Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis. On the surface, most point of sale systems promise the same basic functionality: The ability to accept payments, track sales, manage inventory, and keep track of customer data. There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
<p>Whether they are standing at the bar or chilling on the terrasse, your customers want the full experience. Managing the various specials and happy hour promotions, as well as multiple menus in your business, should be easy and convenient. Revel Systems is a robust point of sale (POS) and business management platform designed to maximize security, stability, ease-of-use, and service delivery. Clover is equipped with technologies that allow you to process credit and debit card payments.</p>
