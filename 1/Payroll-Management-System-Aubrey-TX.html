<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>These portable systems give you the flexibility to process payments right at the point of sale instead of making customers wait in line. If delivery is a significant portion of your business, you'll need a restaurant POS system that specializes in delivery management. A point of sale (POS) is a combination of software and hardware that a business owner needs to run transactions. However, what sets Square apart from most POS systems is that it comes with stellar hardware and software options that are completely free.</p>
<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. Everything is customized to your business based on the features, add-ons, and hardware that you need. Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way. After all, most of us don't think of food as being "inventory," and therefore don't see a logical connection between a UPC bar code number and a yogurt parfait.</p>

Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service.</p>
<p>Not only can Free POS Software provide a basic level of functionality, but there are other features worth noting. It can be challenging to create a comfortable ambiance, meet the expectation of restaurant guests, and keep your staff motivated at the same time. Because all our inventory data is integrated with the Retail Pro POS platform, we can sync ERP and POS sales data with our ecommerce, and use it like an endless aisle that shows our full product line without needing to have all those items in store.</p>
