<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. All types of restaurants and bars match process flow to AccuPOS' adaptive system with touch screen, PC, handheld, and tablet. ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. To keep the service and guest experience seamless, you need a nightclub or bar POS system that can keep up with the rush. The POS hardware you need for your bar will typically include a tablet, tablet stand, receipt printer, cash drawer, and credit card terminal or card reader.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability.

Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost.
