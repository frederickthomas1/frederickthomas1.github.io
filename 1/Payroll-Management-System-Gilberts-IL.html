Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>Bartenders should know how to make any drink order a customer can throw at them, even if it's not on the menu.

ShopKeep also offers a countertop POS hardware for the register, card reader and receipt printer.
