<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
<p>Being a restaurateur means focusing on an efficient kitchen and providing customers with great food and drinks. The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment. You can see POS systems in Retail Stores, Restaurants, Hospitals and almost everywhere these days where payments are involved. You can enjoy over 300 features to help run your store- they offer everything from invoicing tools to time clocks.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store. It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>
