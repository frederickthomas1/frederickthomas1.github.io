<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>ShopKeep gives you the ability to view all of your stores on the dashboard and also offers a Pocket App which lets you check in on sales or inventory remotely. Shopify POS is a service that's easy to set up and highly customizable to fit small businesses and scale up as your business grows. In the end, a good POS system enables you to easily make sales, track sales, and enhance your ability to attract more customers, which depends on your special needs.</p>

A quick glance at a shopper's purchase history (or all those customer details you've started collecting!) in Retail Pro can equip your sales associates with the information they need to determine what products your customer would find most interesting and relevant, and make the offer for an upsell when they're in the store.</p>
<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.
