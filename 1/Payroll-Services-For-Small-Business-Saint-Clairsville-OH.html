<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Empower your stores to play a new, expanded role in today's omnichannel reality and dramatically simplify your IT infrastructure requirements with Openbravo web and cloud-based retail POS system.

<p>From inventory tracking to detailed reports and integrations with other business management tools, point of sale software should adapt to your business needs — not the other way around.

<p>First Data and ICICI Merchant Services combines a payment gateway and point-of-sale software and hardware solutions with features such as card & check acceptance, and merchant mobile commerce solutions, and ecommerce gateway. Another helpful option is setting up a few kiosks in your large retail store for your customers to look up pricing and product availability. POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>

<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. Retailers with a lot of inventory need a barcode scanner to help them manage, stock, and speed up their checkout process. POS hold all the tracks for customers and their respective orders with an eye on business loyalty programs, which in return results in better shopper experience.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>It has been proven that businesses that do not accept credit cards for purchases will have at least 60% less sales than similar business that accept credit cards. Example of a restaurant counter with touchscreen POS software by Lightspeed, connected receipt printer, card machine and cash drawer. It provides POS software and hardware, including mobile options.
