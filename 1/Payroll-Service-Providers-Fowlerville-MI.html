<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

<p>Manage staffing needs, menus, marketing campaigns, inventories proactively. If you own a store or shop of any genre, it is virtually impossible in today's competitive business world to survive without having a point of sales system in your cash terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Unfortunately, however, the easy-to-use software layout does not provide the advanced tools you'd need to manage a full-service restaurant.</p>
