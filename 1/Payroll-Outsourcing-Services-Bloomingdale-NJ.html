<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. All in all, offering NFC, EMV, and magstripe payments guarantees you will be able to accommodate your customers no matter their payment method.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers.
