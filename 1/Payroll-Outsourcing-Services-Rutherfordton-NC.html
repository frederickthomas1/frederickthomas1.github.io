Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough. You should be able to see updated sales figures in real time, and run reports on your cost of labor, product profitability, individual employee performance, and more.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>The best POS vendors provide reliable customer support that you can contact around the clock, so even if your business keeps irregular hours or you're working late, you can receive help when you need it. The cashierless POS trend is taken to the extreme in aspirational retail stores like Amazon Go that give us a sneak preview of what the future of retail and the checkout experience might look like. Accept popular payments and avoid lengthy lineups with mobile hardware to check out anywhere in the store.</p>
