The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum.

<p>Some POS systems cater to retailers , whereas others cater to restaurants, so be sure to look for one that fits your specific needs.
