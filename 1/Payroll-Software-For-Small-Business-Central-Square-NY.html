<p>With Shopify POS, you can manage all of your in-store and online selling in one place. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
