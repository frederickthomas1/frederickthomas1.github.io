<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years.

<p>In the hospitality industry a POS system is much better because of the different needs, requests, and reservations of customers. WillPower Pos systems were developed to suit a wide variety of businesses from Retail to Hospitality and specialized shops.
