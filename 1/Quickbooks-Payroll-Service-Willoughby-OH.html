<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years. Transaction Fees - Other charges your restaurant business will possibly incur via POS systems are transaction fees for the payments you process. This is because VAT taxpayers may need to provide a certificate to the tax authorities showing that their cash management system fulfills the new requirements.</p>
<p>In the hospitality industry a POS system is much better because of the different needs, requests, and reservations of customers. WillPower Pos systems were developed to suit a wide variety of businesses from Retail to Hospitality and specialized shops.

<p>Though they are essential to handle day to day operation in a retail store or a restaurant, they do not help generating revenue directly. Point of sales software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that allow them to track the most popular products. The intuitive nature of LAVU's system makes it easy to learn and easy to train on, and the feature-rich iPad platform makes it easy to provide five-star customer service.</p>
