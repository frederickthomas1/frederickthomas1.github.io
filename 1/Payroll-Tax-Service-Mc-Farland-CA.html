<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. 4. POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it. Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features. Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features.
