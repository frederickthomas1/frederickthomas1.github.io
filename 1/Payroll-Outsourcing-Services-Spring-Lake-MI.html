<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>The accurate records of sales and inventory will help you determine which products are selling and which are not. POS systems have three parts: software, hardware and a credit card processor. A basic ‘starter' bundle will cost around £1,795 and includes the bar POS software along with a touchscreen PC, cash drawer, receipt printer, and card reader. Besides the great point of sale features, TouchBistro offers superb remote management and a strong reporting system.</p>
<p>For example, department stores often have POSs for individual product groups, such as appliances, electronics, and apparel. The speed at which point of sale (POS) software is evolving is significant. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.</p>
