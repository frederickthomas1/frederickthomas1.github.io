When you install new point of sale software for your business, make sure that your employers attend a mandatory training session to acquaint them with the intricacies of the program. A POS system can increase profits by providing a quick and reliable check-out process, maintain detailed sales and inventory reports, and provide integrated profit increasing programs such as loyalty programs, coupons, and special discount programs.</p>

<p>First Data and ICICI Merchant Services combines a payment gateway and point-of-sale software and hardware solutions with features such as card & check acceptance, and merchant mobile commerce solutions, and ecommerce gateway. Another helpful option is setting up a few kiosks in your large retail store for your customers to look up pricing and product availability. POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>
