<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>As well, POS software can be integrated into other applications so that all areas of business management can be viewed in one central place. Point of Sale System helps the retailers to manage their physical stores with ease. A major consideration is that of electronic payment clearance, so that the shop can take credit cards and debit cards along with cash. Information on the workload per hour allows for efficient management of your staff.</p>

You can start with the basic features, then add apps for advanced capabilities such as staff scheduling, customer management and loyalty programs, either from the start or as your business grows.</p>

Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

<p>Obviously, you need to consider the cost of the POS system (including the hardware and software).
