<p>Between keeping up with your employees, managing your sales and revenue, keeping track of inventory, and everything else, you might be wishing there was a simpler way to manage your business. Everything from sales to inventory to customer management merges into your POS. When you have enough personnel on the sales floor and at the cash wrap, shoppers intuitively get the message that they are worth your time and staff investment.</p>
<p>Focus POS is sold and supported by a skilled and experienced network of local dealers who provide our customers with support and in-person service when it's needed most. The first POS made for quick-service and takeaway restaurants that bridges online and regular orders. Cumulus Retail from Celerant Technology is cloud-based POS software for smaller retailers. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>Lightspeed allows restaurants to easily build and update menus, adjust floor plans in real time and update stock inventory. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
<p>Our POS comes standard with features which will improve your entire business, without the hidden cost. Build Recipes: make recipes and get information about their nutritional value to prepare excellent menus and manage your food costs well. The only negative to implementing a new restaurant management system is the training time and challenge of learning new software. The features are most comprehensive for inventory and vendor management.</p>
