<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>Check inventory on the fly, assist customers with purchase decisions, and complete transactions — at the counter or out on the sales floor. Square charges a minimal percentage for every tap, dip, or swipe (representing your customer's payment via credit card or mobile device) in your POS device (tablet or smartphone with Square magstripe reader or POS terminal with Square contactless reader). The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window.

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers.
