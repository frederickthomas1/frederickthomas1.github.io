<p>Looking for a way of speeding up the check out process in your supermarket? Reports, data, work orders, employee management, customer profiles—Lightspeed's retail POS software helps you run your entire business with cloud-based tools that you can use to grow. Bottom Line: While Lightspeed Retail POS's UI can be a bit busy, it does provide all of the basic features needed for a solid point-of-sale (POS) system. A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>
<p>Payment terminals, touch screens, and a variety of other POS hardware and POS software options are used to enable the transaction. From ensuring that there's enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary in ensuring that your store runs smoothly. Although there is software designed specifically for bars, most point of sale systems used by restaurants can also be an excellent solution for bars.</p>

We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers. Lessen the rush at bar by letting customers order drinks directly from the app. For instance, if you own a retail store, you need a retail POS system.</p>

The application is designed for ease of use, so you don't need vast technical background to navigate through the application and start processing sales orders, payments, and shipping.</p>
<p>Future POS has been running high volume restaurants for over 19 years. You don't need a valid internet connection to run this restaurant POS software. Understanding the buying trends of individual customers further helps target sales opportunities-provided the information is shared with the right employees at the right time. By offering tools that make it easy to give your customers what they're asking for, you're able to save servers time and provide five-star customer service.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>Valuable reporting insights, ingredient-level inventory, and easy ordering will save you time and money. The inventory management module embedded in Lightspeed allows the business personnel to carry out their day to day activities in a highly organized manner. When customers come back to try and reach your loyalty program's bonuses, they'll slowly start to feel that sense of belonging and being-at-home in your bar, which is the foundation for creating a regular bar customer.</p>

<p>Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features. These fees will be charged to your business based on how many transactions you run, how large each transaction is, and the type of card the customer is paying with. The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>In addition to POS capabilities, it also comes with a Dine-In module to simplify table management, CRM, home delivery management, and live business dashboard. Brightpearl is a retail-focused POS designed to work seamlessly with your business.
