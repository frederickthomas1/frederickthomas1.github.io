<p>Looking for a way of speeding up the check out process in your supermarket? Reports, data, work orders, employee management, customer profilesâ€”Lightspeed's retail POS software helps you run your entire business with cloud-based tools that you can use to grow. Bottom Line: While Lightspeed Retail POS's UI can be a bit busy, it does provide all of the basic features needed for a solid point-of-sale (POS) system. A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>
<p>Interested businesses can give Quickbooks' POS a free trial and pricing is dependent on the hardware and software bundle a business opts for. Many systems let you individually track employee details, shifts, payroll, and more and then send that data to accounting software.

<p>Our POS solutions cover both in-store and online sales. ShopKeep promises business owners the lowest possible integrated payment processing rate so you can save on every transaction.

Table service and fly-by service order entry, cashier financial accountability, and staff communications.</p>

<p>Shopkeep is not just any POS system, they help you grow your bar business. A POS system is one of the most important investments in your bar or restaurant.

With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
