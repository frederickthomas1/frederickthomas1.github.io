<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>

With POS software, restaurant managers and owners can meet many of their practical business needs, from managing daily service all the way up to high-level analytics.</p>

<p>The feature-rich interface has easy-to-use features for searching menu items, making menu changes, and enabling automated countdown.

Although cloud-based software is easy to deploy and maintain for most bars, Ligan said it can be slow and prone to crash if you have an unstable internet connection.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is a cloud-based Point of Sales (POS) and eCommerce solution. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports.
