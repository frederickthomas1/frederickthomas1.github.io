<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management.

A basic ‘starter' bundle will cost around £1,795 and includes the bar POS software along with a touchscreen PC, cash drawer, receipt printer, and card reader. Besides the great point of sale features, TouchBistro offers superb remote management and a strong reporting system.</p>
<p>We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage. Inventory management — Linking back-of-house and front-of-house functions is crucial, and many restaurant POS systems include inventory management features that allow you to be on top of sourcing and purchasing. Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.</p>

<p>Some of the POS systems mentioned on this page were designed specifically for restaurants. Nobly's iPad POS system is an affordable Point of Sale, backed by a powerful Back Office & award-winning customer support. Ability to manage accounts payable, including support for both balance forward (for example, credit cards) and open item accounts, and the ability to reconcile accounts with monthly statements. Because of the importance of accurate data capture in sophisticated point-of-sale systems, retailers are increasingly turning to scanning as an alternative to error-prone keypunch entry." Indeed, scanning became a ubiquitous feature in many of the nation's most modestly-sized retail outlets during the 1990s.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>

Retailers must adhere to specific standards when selecting POS systems, keeping in mind that the perfect marriage of POS with eCommerce is the key to running a successful retail business in the future.
