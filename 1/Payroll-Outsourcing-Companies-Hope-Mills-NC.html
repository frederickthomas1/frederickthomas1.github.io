<p>The right Point of Sale system will give you control over many different areas of your business operations increasing efficiency and profitability. When you install new point of sale software for your business, make sure that your employers attend a mandatory training session to acquaint them with the intricacies of the program. A POS system can increase profits by providing a quick and reliable check-out process, maintain detailed sales and inventory reports, and provide integrated profit increasing programs such as loyalty programs, coupons, and special discount programs.</p>

To help you minimize lost sales due to out of stocks, use replenishment capabilities in Retail Pro. You can accept payments directly by swiping and inserting the customer's cards, scanning checks, and accepting gift cards right on your POS system. A POS system comprises both POS hardware and software. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more.</p>
