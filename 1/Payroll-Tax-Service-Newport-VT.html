The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package.

Adapt to your customers' needs with convertible point of sale systems.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems.
