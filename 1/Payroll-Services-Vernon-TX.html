<p>POS software will sync with the device, allowing you to take orders, check reports, manage customers, and more all with just a few taps. Today's point-of-sale (POS) systems are not just cash registers anymore thanks to new technologies like mobile devices and the cloud.

<p>A POS system for bars and nightclubs, Toast helps your employees spend less time taking orders and more time focusing on your clientele. At the end of the first night of business with the new point of sale system we looked at the sales totals and found that they had done $300 more than identical nights in the recent past.

<p>EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip. One of the biggest advantages of a mobile POS is that it can support your business's growth from one store to many. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt.</p>
