<p>Ordyx is a POS system for restaurants with single or multiple locations. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments.

<p>Manage sales: The software helps tracks your sales and performance, analyses your customers' demands, and gives you complete control of online ordering.

You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
