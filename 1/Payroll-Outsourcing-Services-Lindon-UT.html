<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>These portable systems give you the flexibility to process payments right at the point of sale instead of making customers wait in line. If delivery is a significant portion of your business, you'll need a restaurant POS system that specializes in delivery management.
