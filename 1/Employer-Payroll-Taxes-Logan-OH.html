Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type.

Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way.

Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>Through out the day the software is able to add up the sales being made to provide a total for the owner of the business.
