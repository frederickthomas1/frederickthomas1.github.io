A member database that supports targeted marketing such as coupons and points schemes has high value in increasing sales and keeping customers. Toast is an all-in-one management solution for restauranteurs. Getting holistic, real-time data in the hands of key decision makers allows them to take immediate action and improve performance in your stores.

<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>

Win back churned customers and increase customer lifetime value with in-built loyalty that tracks all customer contacts and purchasing preferences; launch targeted promotions, offers, and personalized campaigns that keep customers coming back.
