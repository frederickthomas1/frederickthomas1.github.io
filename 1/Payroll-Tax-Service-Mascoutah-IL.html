<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
<p>Substitutions, drink recipe lists, price scheduling, tab management, and split inventory for liquor pours are just a few features to look for in bar POS software. Another important aspect of POS software is broad support for new payment systems. Lightspeed register terminals are iPad-based and provide access to the backend business management system. However, it is advisable to opt for the software that best suits your business requirements and smoothens your business operations to provide top-notch customer service.</p>

<p>In short the software makes running the retail store easily and conveniently. Smaller restaurants or food trucks can trim down options to the basics for what small food service needs. We focused our products on two vertical markets; Computer Service & Retail Point of Sales and Restaurant Point of Sales. Some systems offer functionality which is close to that offered by CMS packages; for example, sending emails to customers to thank them for sales, advertise bargains or offer coupons, and offer other loyalty perks.</p>
<p>This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. A proper POS system can streamline your retail outlet & saves time, a flawed one can complicate even the little things, thus making the process of checkout frustrating for anyone at the payment counter. It is a good idea to talk to your employees and your customers to get feedback on what kinds of features would help. Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine.</p>

<p>TouchBistro is one of the most reliable POS systems for bars. The online shop will know when the item is sold out at the retail store, in turn stating that the item is out of stock.

<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock.

While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
