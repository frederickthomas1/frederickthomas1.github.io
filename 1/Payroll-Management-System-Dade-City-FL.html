<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility â€” keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>GiftLogic is Windows-based POS software for retailers. The sales module lets you tag your popular selling items for building a business. An often-overlooked capability of point of sale software is the ability of intelligent software to assist in promoting increased sales volumes. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems.</p>
<p>You can't expect your clients to enjoy there shopping if they stand in a queue for 15 - 20 minutes, so be sure the point of sale (POS) retail side is fast. Our POS software is intuitive and very easy to use.
